# Cubic Bézier Offset Curve Development

### Description
This is the working repository for a paper covering [a new Bézier curve fitting method](https://raphlinus.github.io/curves/2022/09/09/parallel-beziers.html).

### Tasks
- [] Complete introduction / background section
- [] Generate & embed illustrations showing offset curve development
- [] Canonical implementation of method
  - [] Review cusp identification implementation
- [] Analytical review of error bounds
- [] Implementation of competing methods (Euler spiral, Tiller-Hanson, Yang-Huang, Klass, Hoschek-Wissel)
- [] Numerical review of error scaling and comparison with other methods implemented
